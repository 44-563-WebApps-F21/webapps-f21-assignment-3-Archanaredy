        <h1>The black Cheetha</h1>

        <P>Cheetah is arguably the most recognizable of Wonder Woman villains, perhaps even winning the title of “archvillain” to the iconic hero</P>

        <ul>
            <li>Her basic attributes consist of enhanced strength and speed well beyond that of the most powerful felines </li>
            <li> As well as heightened senses of smell and hearing for hunts and night vision for stealth</li>
        </ul>
